Project is provided as is and can't provide any guarantees around whether things will assemble properly as this was a quick, weekend project and largely vide-coded with help from ChatGPT.

## Features

Using all sorts of parameters, and intersingly using some concepts out of audio synthesis, allowing to set 2 LFOs (low frequency oscillators) to modulate the parameters of the lamp shade.

## Usage

Only requirement for usage is to share pics of things you build using this!

## Work in Progress

NOTE: I have yet to print my first one, but wanted to share after making some progress

While promising, many things on my TODO list:

- make sure notches land in the right place and generally align
- guarantee proportions in ways that align with thickness of the material use
- for the "spiral effect, provide the right "give" in ways that account for the difformation
- improve the "organic" look with the proper "randomness" and "noise" factors
